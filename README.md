Update of Mehnis mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1114619043



-  Added a setting for selecting the lowest preferability of food to be counted
	DesperateOnly,RawBad,RawTasty,MealAwful,MealSimple,MealFine,MealLavish
	Examples for each category shows in the config-dialog
-  Changed the calculations for food, instead using the exact amount the pawns require
	This should make the mod show more correct values and also ignore pawns that do not eat
-  Russian translation fixed by Morbo
-  Added compatibility with [SOS2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1909914131)
-  Italian translation by arl85
-  Spanish translation by Ferchu
-  German translation by thephluxer
-  Food calculations should now be done more seldom when there is a lot of food. There is a slider for setting a static update-value if needed.
-  For Chinese tranlsation, use [Food Alert_zh](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3246861614) by  摄魂狼
-  Added support for [Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920385763), thanks to malnormalulo!
