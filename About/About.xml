Update of Mehnis mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1114619043

- Added a setting for selecting the lowest preferability of food to be counted
	DesperateOnly,RawBad,RawTasty,MealAwful,MealSimple,MealFine,MealLavish
	Examples for each category shows in the config-dialog
- Changed the calculations for food, instead using the exact amount the pawns require
	This should make the mod show more correct values and also ignore pawns that do not eat
- Russian translation fixed by Morbo
- Added compatibility with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1909914131]SOS2[/url]
- Italian translation by arl85
- Spanish translation by Ferchu
- German translation by thephluxer
- Food calculations should now be done more seldom when there is a lot of food. There is a slider for setting a static update-value if needed.

Shows a persistent readout with the amount of food you currently have in storage, and an estimate of how long stocks will last. Prevent sudden starvation by knowing how your food supplies are doing.

v0.1.1.1 Russian language added, thanks to Alex.
v0.1.1.0 RimWorld 1.0 compatible
v0.1.0.1 Now has a way nicer readout with all the sexy things I wanted to add.

Thanks to Brrainz - for Harmony and a lot of the code for that readout :)
