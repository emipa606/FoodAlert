    <content>Improved food-need calculation. (in 1.2) 
The mod should now look at the specific food-need per pawn instead of using a default value per pawn.
This means that the need should update if a pawn gets a larger hunger need due to a disease for example.
It also means that it ignores pawns that do not need food, depending on how the pawn is defined.
There is also an extra row in the info-box that shows the total amount of food eaten per day.
